    <h1>PSA ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>
    <h2>American Stroke Association</h2>
    <h3>2023 | CAMPAIGN DESIGN</h3>
    <p>This is a PSA Campaign project for the American Stroke Association. Suffering from a cerebral palsy stroke at birth I would like educate the general public on stroke awareness to be alert on the possible symptoms that might occur.  This campaign conveys that message through my punk-style poster compositions, infographics, guerilla marketing and a little bit of humor. </p>

            <h2>Aphasia</h2>
                <p>Speech impairment also known as aphasia is caused by strokes on the left side of the brain which affects your language and ability to communicate.  As a result the stroke victim might havedifficulty undersanding others, getting words out and finding/processing words.  I was able to communicate those symptoms and convey my message by using dingbats which are typographic symbols/ornaments that are not used as real language.</p>

            <h2>Drooping</h2>
                <p>Facial drooping is a result from nerve damage and facial muscles not working properly, it may be a form of bell's palsy, a stroke or other related conditions. There are a wide range of symptoms that might occur, some of them might include a change in taste, difficulty eating or making facial expressions, ear pain, headaches, seizures and loss of smell or hearing.  I was able to communicate those symptoms and convey my message through a lack of balance in facial structure such as having an uneven mustasche.</p>

            <h2>Hemiparesis</h2>
                <p>Hemiparesis is a term for one-sided weakness or inability to move as a result of a stroke.  These symptoms may cause difficulty walking, muscle fatigue, loss of balance, lack of coordination as well as diffuclty in movement and grabbing objects. I was able to communicate those symptoms and convey my message through one-sided weakness and a loss of balance wih the man falling over.</p>

    <h2>Guerilla Marketing</h2>
    <p>Guerilla Marketing is an unconventional approach to spreading brand awareness and publicity often in public environments in unique and distinctive ways of display which intrigues and catches the audiences attention.  Below are some examples of my guerilla marketing approach for the American Stroke Association showcasing aphasia, drooping and hemiparesis.  I encourage you to take a guess on the message I am trying to convey.</p>

            <h2>My Challenge</h2>
                <p>Finding a clear direction for this campaign was my biggest challenge.  This first came with thinking in a conceptual manner to find and focus on the simple, core message for each composition.</p>

        <div class="column one-half">
            <h2>My Solution</h2>
                <p>Took a deep dive into each concept through rough sketching and explored different styles of posters and ended up developing my own unique style from that.  Along with infographics and guerilla marketing, I was able to use the surrounding environment to tell a story.</p>
