    <h2>This is Criminal Podcast</h2>
    <h3>2021 | BOOK COVER DESIGN</h3>
    <p>“This is Criminal” is a podcast based on real-life crime events and hosted by American journalist, Pheobe Judge. After listening to a few episodes, I chose the three that took my interest: The Checklist, American Dream and Willie Bosket, and designed book covers based on those episodes.</p>

            <h2>My Challenge</h2>
                <p>Listening to each podcasts and grasping the "concept" from each story was difficult. To then visualize each concept  and turn it into a book cover was the biggest challenge for me.</p>

        <div class="cloumn one-half">
            <h2>My Solution</h2>
                <p>Sketching different variations of the concept helped me visualize and gave me the direction I needed to create the book cover.</p>
