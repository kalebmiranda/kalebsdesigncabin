    <h1>PHOTO MONTAGE</h1>
    <h2>Blending into the Elements</h2>
    <h3>2022 | Digital Imaging</h3>
    <p>As I came up with an idea for a photo composition, I thought of different sceneries I could use together, then I went on a little adventure to take some shots.  Along with a little cutting, trimming, effects and inspiration from books like “Where's Waldo?” I found a way to disguise myself into the water, bushes, mountains and combine everything all into one.  The concept for this composition came from my interest in collage which became a side hobby of mine  as well as my interests in art styles like surrealism.</p>
