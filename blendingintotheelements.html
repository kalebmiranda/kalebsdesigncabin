    <h1>PHOTO MONTAGE</h1>
    <h2>Blending into the Elements</h2>
    <h3>2022 | Digital Imaging</h3>
    <p>As I came up with an idea for a surrealist photo composition, I thought of different sceneries I could use together, then I went on a little adventure to take some shots.  Along with a little cutting, trimming, effects and inspiration from books like “Where's Waldo?” I found a way to disguise myself into the water, bushes, mountains and combine everything all into one.  The concept for this composition came from my interest in collage which became a side hobby of mine  as well as my interests in art styles like surrealism.</p>

            <h2>My Challenge</h2>
                <p>Masking out the parts of the photos I wanted and placing them in the composition while blending everthinhg together and making it look as natural as possible was a difficult process.</p>

            <h2>My Solution</h2>
                <p>After adjusting the brightness and contrast of my photos and doing the last revisions I think the final composition exceeded my own expectations. This has been my first attempt at surrealism and it has definitely inspired me to create more of this style in the future.</p>
